    "On problem set 9, you looked at the process $pp\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^- X$.  This process occurs via the electomagnetic interaction. The cross section (calculated to lowest order in perturbationtheory) is  proportional to $\\alpha^2$ (a factor of $e^2$ in the matrix element leads to a factor of  $e^4$ in the cross section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider instead the process $pp\\rightarrow jjX$ where $j$ is a jet coming from  the hadronization of a parton (a quark, an antiquark or a gluon).  This process occurs through the strong interaction and the lowest order term for the cross section is therefore proportional to $\\alpha_S^2$. Draw all the Feynman diagrams that contribute to this lowest order calculation.  You are not required to label the vertex or propagator factors but you should put arrows on the lines corresponding to incoming or outgoing fermions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Feynman diagrams show only the partons (quarks, anti-quarks or gluons) that are part of the scattering process and not the other partons in the proton).  Draw the diagrams with time going from right to left and take the upper incoming line to be the parton moving in the $+z$ direction and the bottom incoming line to be the parton moving in the $-z$ direction (in other words, consider $gq\\rightarrow gq$ to be a different diagram from $qg\\rightarrow qg$.  You should NOT draw separate diagrams for different quark species ($u$, $d$, $s$, etc) but just call all of them $q$.  You should consider both valence and sea partons, so that there are diagrams with intial state $\\overline q$ as well as those with intial state $q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- The three vertices that describe the couplings of the strong interaction are shown on page 6 of the Lecture 19 notes. \n",
    "- In many cases, both for s-channel and t-channel diagrams are possible \n",
    "- There are quite a large number of such diagrams.  Start by listing all the possible initial state combinations of partons and then for each initial state then draw all the relevant scattering diagrams for that initial state."
