    "In Classical Mechanics, the *Lagrangian* is a useful quantity that helps encapsulate the dynamics of a system via the Euler-Lagrange equations. In a classical system, the Lagrangian can often be expressed as $$ L = T - V$$ where $T$ is the kinetic energy of the system and $V$ is the potential energy of the system. The action, S, of a trajectory is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian with respect to time during the trajectory, i.e. $$ S = \\int L \\hspace{0.05in} dt $$\n",

    "Now, according to special relativity, we should treat space and time on equal footing. In natural units, this is quite easy, since converting from one to the other amounts to multiplying or dividing by $c$, which we have set to 1. Thus, we should re-write the action as an integral over all four space-time dimensions. To do this, we introduce the *Lagrangian density* $\\mathcal{L}$, which is defined by: $$L = \\int \\mathcal{L \\hspace{0.05in}} d^3x $$\n",

In fact, it is so important that we often just called it \"the Lagrangian,\" making the distinction between $L$ and $\\mathcal{L}$ a matter of absolute confusion. Lucky us! Nonetheless, we will focus on the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$."
